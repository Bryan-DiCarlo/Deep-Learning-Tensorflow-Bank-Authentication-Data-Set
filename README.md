# Deep-Learning-Tensorflow-Bank-Authentication-Data-Set
The Bank Authentication Data Set is from the UCI repository. Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged 
banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 
pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. 
Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images. We use a Tensorflow Deep Learning Model to predict if bank note was
authentic or not.  This model performed very well. Correctly classifying the bank notes ~99% of the time.  To make sure this was not an
anomaly.  We also tested a Random Forest Model and the results were almost identical. Indicating both sets of results were more than likely
correct and not an anomaly.
